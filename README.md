# Grand Prix Geek: Learning Statistics through a Formula 1 Lens

## About The Project

The "Grand Prix Geek" series is a personal endeavor that combines my passion for Formula 1 racing with the world of statistics. This project aims to simplify complex statistical concepts through the sport's rich, quantitative data. Each article pairs a specific slice of the Ergast Formula 1 dataset with a statistical concept, turning abstract theories into tangible, practical learning experiences.

Inspired by my own challenges in grasping statistics, "Grand Prix Geek" seeks to make the subject matter approachable and engaging for beginners. By leveraging real-world data from the exhilarating realm of Formula 1, this series demystifies statistics and illustrates its relevance in analyzing and predicting race outcomes, pit stop strategies, and more.

### Features

- **Stats in a Snap**: Introduction to basic statistical concepts using Formula 1 data.
- **Seeing is Believing**: Data visualization techniques to explore Formula 1 statistics.
- **Racing the Odds**: Probability theory applied to Formula 1 racing outcomes.
- **Box, Box**: Linear regression models predicting the impact of pit stops.
- **Box, Box 2**: Logistic regression applications in Formula 1 pit stop strategies.
- **Pole Position**: Bayesian inference for predicting final race positions from grid placements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
